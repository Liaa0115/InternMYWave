Proposed Indexes :

1. Composite Index on 'department' and 'salary':
	
	CREATE INDEX idx_department_salary ON employees(department, salary); 

Reasoning : This index helps the database quickly find rows that match both 'department' and 'salary' conditions, speeding up the query.


2. Individual Index on 'salary':

	CREATE INDEX idx_salary ON employees(salary);

Reasoning :  If the query often filters on 'salary' alone, this index will make those searches faster.


How the Indexes Help :

- Composite Index (department, salary): Filters the rows by department first, then by salary, reducing the amount of data the database needs to search through.
- Individual Index on salary: Speeds up queries that filter by salary only.


Trade-offs and Drawbacks :

- More Storage: Indexes take up extra space on the disk.

- Slower Write Operations: Adding, updating, or deleting records will be slightly slower because the indexes need to be updated too.

- Complexity: Having too many indexes can make the database slower in some cases, especially if it picks the wrong one for a query.
